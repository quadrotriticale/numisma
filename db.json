Construction of the cathedral began in 1221 and it was already in use as a place of worship nine years later, although work continued off and on until 1567. It was primarily built in the French Gothic style, but Renaissance features were added in the 15th and 16th centuries. The name of the country of issue, “ESPAÑA”, and the year “2012” appear to the left and right above the image. The mintmark (M with a crown) appears to the right. The outer ring bears the 12 stars of the European Union.",

                    "description": "The design depicts a carved relief with two gods from Roman mythology standing before the entrance to the main building of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank (OeNB): to the left, Mercury, the messenger of the gods and the god of merchants and commerce; to the right, Fortuna, the goddess of fate and prosperity, who is portrayed with a horn of plenty. The background detail, running from the left to the right edges of the core, shows the OeNB’s main premises. An ornamental band skirting the bottom of the coin centre evokes the red-white-red pattern of the Austrian national flag, with hatched vertical lines symbolising the colour red, as laid down in the rules of heraldic design. The years ‘1816’ and ‘2016’ to the left of Mercury refer to the OeNB’s founding year and its bicentennial. The inscriptions running along the edges of the gold-coloured centre read ‘Republik Österreich’ (Republic of Austria) and ‘200 Jahre Oesterreichische Nationalbank’ (200 years of Oesterreichische Nationalbank). The coin’s outer ring bears the 12 stars of the European Union.",

                    "description": "The design shows the statue of Hibernia perched at the top of the General Post Office building – the seizure of which marked the beginning of the Easter rising back in 1916. She is a symbol of Ireland. Her name was taken from the ancient Greek reference for Ireland and her form was realised by the sculptor John Smyth. She is viewed as a witness to the events of 1916 and, in the 100 years since, she has seen the nation blossom before her based on the ideals set out in the Proclamation. She continues to look forward and is a symbol of the past, present and future of the country. At the top of the inner circle, the inscription ‘HIBERNIA’ appears in hand‑rendered lettering that takes influence from the historic Book of Kells. The sunrays reflect well the underlying concept of the Rising and the Proclamation, e.g. the dawning of the new nation/republic. The image of the statue is flanked by the years ‘1916’ and ‘2016’. At the bottom of the inner circle appears the name of the issuing country ‘éire’ and, underneath it, the year of issuance ‘2016’. The coin’s outer ring bears the 12 stars of the European Union.",
